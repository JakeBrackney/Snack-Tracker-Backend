# Snack-Tracker-Backend

## Description

Snack Tracker is an app where users can keep track of their favorite and most memorable item on the menu from various restaurants they've been to. Anyone can comment on a snack post and share their ideas about it. This repo contains the back end of the application. 

## Functionality

Using express, our routes are built to allow a user to see a list of restaurants, to retrieve JSON data about a single restaurant, to delete a restaurant, and to add comments to a restaurant.

## Technologies

The application as a whole is built using a MERN stack. The backend employs Mongoose, Express, and Node. We tied the front end and back end using Cors and deployed the back end to Heroku.

## Installed Back End Dependencies

- Body Parser
- Cors
- Express
- Mongoose

## Improvements

We would like to implement a user model and employ authentication with Passport. We would also like to build a route that allows the user to add a new restaurant to their list. These would really round out the functionality of the application.
